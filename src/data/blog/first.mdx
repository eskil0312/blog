In the world of cloud infrastructure management, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have become essential for automating and managing cloud resources. Among the popular choices, Terraform, Azure Bicep, and Pulumi are widely used by cloud engineers and DevOps teams. In this article, we will compare these three tools, highlighting their features, code examples, and pros and cons.

## 1. Terraform

Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, is one of the most widely adopted IaC tools in the industry. It allows you to define infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers and services using a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Here are a few code examples to showcase Terraform's capabilities:

## Example 1: Provisioning an Azure Static Web App with Terraform

```
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "my-resource-group"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "mystorageaccount"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" {
  name                  = "web"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  container_access_type = "private"
}

resource "azurerm_static_site" "example" {
  name                = "my-static-site"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  account_name        = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  container_name      = azurerm_storage_container.example.name

  app_settings = {
    "WEBSITE_SCM_TYPE" = "LocalGit"
  }
}
```
