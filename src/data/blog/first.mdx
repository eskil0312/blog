In the world of cloud infrastructure management, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have become essential for automating and managing cloud resources. Among the popular choices, Terraform, Azure Bicep, and Pulumi are widely used by cloud engineers and DevOps teams. In this article, we will compare these three tools, highlighting their features, code examples, and pros and cons.

Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, is one of the most widely adopted IaC tools in the industry. It allows you to define infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers and services using a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). Here are a few code examples to showcase Terraform's capabilities:
